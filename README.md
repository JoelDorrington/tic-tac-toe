# tic-tac-toe
My first project combining HTML, CSS and Javascript

I coded this little tic-tac-toe game in about a week back in mid 2017.
In February 2018 I applied some new OOP techniques I was learning to refactor the code and make it cleaner.
I included both of the JavaScript files, original and refactored, but some of the HTML features aren't supported by the original JavaScript file. Keep that in mind if you choose to swap-in the original code.

I was spending a lot of time on it and my girlfriend was getting annoyed, so I asked her for input to get her involved. She wanted to play with puppies and kittens, so there you go.

To play, just open the HTML5 file in your browser, change the players' names if you want, choose the player sprites, and hit play. You can choose who starts first at the top of the page.

I hope you enjoy the game!
