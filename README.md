# tic-tac-toe
My first project combining HTML, CSS and Javascript

I coded this little tic-tac-toe game in about a week back in mid 2017.
In February 2018 I applied some new OOP techniques I was learning to refactor the code and make it cleaner.

I was spending a lot of time on it and my girlfriend was getting annoyed, so I asked her for input to get her involved. She wanted to play with puppies and kittens.

I hope you enjoy the game!
